The .py file need to be inmported to catkin workspace in order to work.
Starting positon q0 = (0m,0m,0m).
The robot makes a total of 5 moves with the parabolic segments equations:
  i) Turns 26.56 degrees around z-axis. Total time needed 3 seconds.
  ii) Does a smooth linear motion to reach qv = [20m , 10m , 0m]. Total time needed 150 seconds seconds.
  iii) Turns  to reach 270 degrees around z-axis. Total time needed 10 seconds.
  iv) Does a smooth linear motion to reach qf = [20m , -10m, 0m]. Total time needed 150 seconds seconds.
  v) Turns  to reach 117,42 degrees around z-axis. Total time needed 10 seconds.
  
Graphs pictures of each move are created by the form of pictures.
